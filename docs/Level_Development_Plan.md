# The Elemental Echo - Level Development Plan
*Transforming from Free-Float to 2D Platformer*

## 🎯 Vision Statement
Transform our current free-floating Echo into a **Fireboy and Watergirl inspired 2D platformer** with gravity-based movement, cave environments, and platform-based puzzle solving while preserving our existing health, narrative, and elemental systems.

## 📋 Current State Analysis

### What We Have ✅
- ✅ Echo with elemental form switching (Fire/Water)
- ✅ Health system with visual feedback
- ✅ Text-tag narrative system
- ✅ Ice wall melting mechanic
- ✅ Heartspring healing system
- ✅ Basic collision detection

### What Needs Transformation 🔄
- 🔄 **Movement**: Free-floating → Gravity + Jumping platformer
- 🔄 **Level Design**: Empty space → Cave platforms and paths
- 🔄 **Camera**: Static follow → Platform-appropriate framing
- 🔄 **Visual Style**: Simple shapes → Cave/stone aesthetic

## 🗺️ Level Design Philosophy

### Core Layout Principles
1. **Horizontal Progression**: Left-to-right advancement like Fireboy & Watergirl
2. **Vertical Challenges**: Platforms requiring jumping and elemental switching
3. **Clear Paths**: Obvious routes with elemental barriers
4. **Visual Storytelling**: Environment tells the story of fading energy

### Reference Inspiration
- **Fireboy & Watergirl**: Cave aesthetics, cooperative puzzles, elemental interactions
- **Our Story**: Dim caverns, fading Heartsprings, ancient decay
- **Platformer Classics**: Clear visual hierarchy, intuitive level flow

## 🎮 Movement System Redesign

### Phase 1: Basic Platformer Physics
**Goal**: Transform Echo from floating to walking/jumping

**Changes Needed**:
- Add gravity constant (980 pixels/second²)
- Implement jump mechanic (single jump, ~400px height)
- Ground detection and landing
- Platform edge detection

**New Controls**:
- **WASD/Arrows**: Left/Right movement, Up for jump
- **Space**: Elemental form switching (unchanged)

### Phase 2: Enhanced Movement
- Variable jump height (hold for higher jump)
- Coyote time (brief jump window after leaving platform)
- Jump buffering (early jump input registration)

## 🏗️ Level Architecture Plan

### Layout Structure
```
[Start Platform] → [Gap + Jump] → [Ice Wall] → [Platform Series] → [Heartspring Platform]
```

### Detailed Level Sections

#### Section 1: Tutorial Area (0-200px)
- **Ground Level**: Solid platform for initial movement
- **Text Trigger**: "The air here feels... still. Something stirs within me."
- **Purpose**: Teach basic movement and jumping

#### Section 2: First Challenge (200-500px)
- **Gap**: 80px wide (requires jump to cross)
- **Elevated Platform**: 60px higher than start
- **Purpose**: Introduce jumping mechanic

#### Section 3: Ice Wall Puzzle (500-800px)
- **Ice Wall**: Blocks upward path, requires Fire form
- **Text Trigger**: "A deep cold lingers in this ice. Fire might loosen this grip."
- **Alternative Water Path**: Lower tunnel for Water form (future expansion)
- **Purpose**: Core elemental puzzle from our MVP

#### Section 4: Platform Series (800-1200px)
- **Stepping Stones**: 3-4 platforms requiring precise jumping
- **Height Variation**: Mix of low and high platforms
- **Purpose**: Movement mastery and progression flow

#### Section 5: Heartspring Chamber (1200-1400px)
- **Final Platform**: Elevated sacred area
- **Heartspring**: Goal object with healing
- **Text Trigger**: "This pulse... it is so weak. Yet hope flickers within."
- **Purpose**: Satisfying conclusion and health restoration

## 🎨 Visual Design Integration

### Tileset Requirements
**Essential Tiles**:
- Ground platform (64x64px)
- Wall/ceiling tiles
- Background cave texture
- Platform edges/corners

**Visual Style**:
- **Color Palette**: Dark stone (#2A2F38) with blue-grey accents
- **Lighting**: Dim ambient with Echo's elemental glow as primary light source
- **Texture**: Rough stone with subtle moss/crystal details

### UI Adaptations
- **Health Bar**: Top-left corner (existing system works)
- **Text Tags**: Center-screen positioning for platformer view
- **Form Indicator**: Bottom-left with elemental glow

## 📈 Implementation Phases

- Smooth left/right movement

### Phase 2: Level Geometry (Week 2)
**Goals**:
- ✅ Create platform tilemap system
- ✅ Design basic level layout
- ✅ Integrate existing ice wall into platform structure
- ✅ Position Heartspring appropriately

**Success Criteria**:
- Complete path from start to Heartspring
- Platforms feel stable and responsive
- Visual hierarchy guides player progression

### Phase 3: System Integration (Week 3)
**Goals**:
- ✅ Adapt health system for platformer gameplay
- ✅ Reposition text triggers for new level layout
- ✅ Ensure ice wall melting works with platforms
- ✅ Test complete gameplay flow

**Success Criteria**:
- All existing systems work in new level design
- Smooth progression from start to finish
- Narrative beats hit at appropriate moments

### Phase 4: Polish & Enhancement (Week 4)
**Goals**:
