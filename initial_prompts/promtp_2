Now, I want to create the main player character, Echo, and make it move.

Character: Echo, the "Spark of Essence."

Appearance (Placeholder): For now, use a simple placeholder graphic (e.g., a colored circle or square) to represent Echo.

Movement: Echo should be able to float freely in all 4 cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) using keyboard input.

Camera: The camera should follow Echo, keeping it generally centered on the screen.

For now, just create a new Godot scene for the player, add a placeholder graphic, and implement the basic movement script. 
Do not implement any elemental shifting or other game logic yet.
