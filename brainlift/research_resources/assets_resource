Okay, I understand perfectly. You want a second, follow-up prompt specifically for Godot, focusing only on getting Echo to move, without mentioning forms yet, and without the extraneous "gnome_sprite.png" reference or complex instructions. You're also looking for asset library recommendations.

Here is the precise, simplified prompt you can use:

Prompt 2: "The Elemental Echo" - Basic Player Movement

Now, I want to create the main player character, Echo, and make it move.

Character: Echo, the "Spark of Essence."

Appearance (Placeholder): For now, use a simple placeholder graphic (e.g., a colored circle or square) to represent Echo.

Movement: Echo should be able to float freely in all 4 cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) using keyboard input.

Camera: The camera should follow Echo, keeping it generally centered on the screen.

For now, just create a new Godot scene for the player, add a placeholder graphic, and implement the basic movement script. Do not implement any elemental shifting or other game logic yet.

Asset Library Recommendations for "The Elemental Echo"

Since you're looking for simple assets for Echo's placeholder and later for the elemental effects, here are some excellent free asset libraries that are very beginner-friendly and suitable for Godot:

Kenney.nl:

Why it's good: Kenney provides a vast collection of high-quality, consistent, and free (public domain/CC0) game assets. You can find everything from UI elements to particles, simple character sprites, and environmental tiles.

For Echo: You could use a simple circle sprite, or explore their "Particle Pack" or "Space Kit" for ethereal-looking shapes.

For Levels: Their "Platformer Kit" or "Tilemap Pack" has generic blocks that can be easily re-colored to represent rock/ice.

Itch.io (Free Assets Section):

Why it's good: Many indie developers and artists release free asset packs here. You can find unique and diverse styles.

Search for: "2D particle pack," "magic effects," "elemental sprites," "orb sprite," or "glowing sphere." Many artists have simple sprite sheets perfect for a "Spark of Essence."

OpenGameArt.org:

Why it's good: A large repository of open-source game art. You can filter by type, license, and style.

Search for: "2D effects," "magic spells," "particle," "orb," "glowing."

For your MVP, to represent Echo:
I'd suggest simply drawing a colored circle in a basic image editor (like Paint, GIMP, or even a browser-based tool like Pixilart.com for pixel art) and exporting it as a .png. A 16x16px or 32x32px circle would be a good starting size. This is simpler than using a complex sprite sheet for just movement.

When you're ready for elemental shifting, you can create two versions: a red circle for Flame Form and a blue circle for Water Form.
